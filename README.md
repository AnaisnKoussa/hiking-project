# hiking-project

Realized by Lydia Haway, Latifa Leclercq & Ana√Øs Koussa

## Introduction

We had to develop an application capable of storing hikes. This site had to be collaborative. This means users can log in and add their own trails.

## Functionalities
  
  * Show all the hikes with all the info from the database 
  * Show all the info from one single hike
  * Display the list of hikes per tag
  * A subscription page that allows the user to create an account to be able to create hikes
  * A connection page that allows the user to access to his own data, edit his profile
  * An admin account that allows admins to edit and delete any trail and delete any user or tag

## Goals

  * Creation of our database 
  * Creation of our dynamic website
  * Use a router
  * OOP
  * MVC architecture
  * Agile methodology

## Technologies

PHP, HTML, SASS, JS
